# Simple Piano Tool

A simple piano tool built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows users to play piano notes by clicking on the keys.

## Features
- Interactive piano keys.
- Play notes using mouse clicks.
- Responsive design for a seamless experience on different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the piano keys.
- **CSS**: For styling the piano and making it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: For handling the logic to play notes when keys are clicked.

## How It Works
- Each piano key is represented by a `div` element in the HTML.
- CSS is used to style the keys to resemble a real piano (white and black keys).
- JavaScript uses the Web Audio API to generate and play sounds when a key is clicked.
